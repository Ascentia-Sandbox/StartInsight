Component displays 3 data points: Current Interest (color-coded by trend direction: Green for rising, Red for falling, Amber for stable), Average Interest (gray), Peak Interest (blue). Implemented trend direction badge with color-coded styling (Green background for rising, Red for falling, Amber for stable) and directional icons (↑ rising, ↓ falling, → stable). Added summary statistics grid with 3 cards (Current Interest, 7-Day Average, Peak Interest) showing numerical values with responsive layout. Component only renders for google_trends source data, null for other sources. Updated RawSignalSummarySchema in types.ts to include extra_metadata field (z.record(z.string(), z.any()).nullable().optional()) for flexible metadata storage varying by source. Fixed Zod schema error (z.record requires 2 arguments: key schema and value schema). Updated TrendChartProps interface to accept flexible Record<string, any> type in addition to structured TrendData. Integrated TrendChart into insight detail page (app/insights/[id]/page.tsx) below source information, passing insight.raw_signal.extra_metadata and source props. Chart features dark mode compatibility with currentColor text fills, responsive design with ResponsiveContainer, accessible labels with proper axis descriptions, graceful null handling when no trend data available.

Built ThemeToggle component with Moon/Sun icons (lucide-react), SSR-safe rendering using mounted state, smooth theme transitions. Configured Tailwind v4 dark mode using `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))` for class-based theming. Integrated into layout.tsx with ThemeProvider wrapping entire app, added suppressHydrationWarning to html tag. Fixed SSR hydration issues by using dynamic import with `ssr: false` in Header component to prevent server-side rendering of theme toggle. Error Boundaries: Created root error boundary (app/error.tsx) with Card UI displaying error message and digest, "Try again" button calling reset(), "Go to Homepage" fallback link, console logging. Created global error boundary (app/global-error.tsx) with inline styles (no Tailwind dependency) for critical app-level errors, graceful degradation.

Responsive Design & Loading Skeletons: Already implemented in Phase 3.1-3.5 (mobile-first responsive grid 1/2/3 columns, loading skeletons on all pages with h-64/h-96 heights, grid layout preservation during loading, Suspense boundary fallbacks). Production build: ✅ PASSED (0 TypeScript errors, 0 hydration warnings, all routes generated successfully). Created comprehensive test documentation (test_phase_3_6.md, 329 lines) with detailed success criteria for all 4 requirements, feature verification checklists (dark mode, responsive, loading states, error boundaries), build test results.

  - Technical notes: Expanded Memory Bank Protocol section from 4 lines to 45 lines with comprehensive coverage of all 6 memory-bank files (project-brief.md, active-context.md, implementation-plan.md, architecture.md, tech-stack.md, progress.md). Added priority-based reading order, context-based reading guide table with 6 scenarios, and "when to read" guidance for each file. Added "Context Refresh" rule to Workflows section. Previously critical files like architecture.md (769 lines) were completely unmentioned - now 100% coverage achieved.
